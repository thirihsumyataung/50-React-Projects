# Values Js 

### npm install values.js --save 

### Clip-bord 

- copy value to clip board 
- Once we clip it , it will copy value to clip board and message will be showed for 3 sec, then will be disappeared. 
- eg: all(20) ==> we will have less color --> notice , in this case we will divide 100 by 20 
- all(1) ==> we will have full shades since 100 % by 1
